Welcome to RV-Monitor's documentation!
--------------------------------------

RV-Monitor is a software development and analysis framework aiming at reducing the gap between 
formal specification and implementation by allowing them together to form a system. With RV-Monitor, 
runtime monitoring is supported and encouraged as a fundamental principle for building reliable 
software: monitors are synthesized from specified properties and integrated into the original 
system to check its dynamic behaviors during execution.
