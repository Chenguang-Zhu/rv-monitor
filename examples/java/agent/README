To run this agent (which consists of all 200 propertydb Java API properties developed thusfar by RV Inc), 
simple replace "java" in your commands with "rv-monitor-all" to run any Java programs with no further configuration.

Several examples of both correct and incorrect programs are provided in this directory.  To run them, simply use
"javac [example].java" followed by "rv-monitor-all [example.java]".  The violation of any of the 200 included properties
should be displayed to the screen, along with an explanation of the violated property.

To run the agent manually (without the included script) simply add -javaagent:all-java-api-properties.jar
to the Java command required to run any program.  Make sure the RV-Monitor lib folder is added to your classpath.
