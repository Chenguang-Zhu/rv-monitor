Linux:
 To build the tests without monitoring
    
  make

 To run the unmonitored tests
  ./test1
  ./test2
 
 Nothing should be printed for the unmonitored tests as they don't have 
 output.

 To instrument the tests for monitoring, after building normally
  
  make -f Makefile.Instrument

 To run the instrumented tests
  ./test1
  ./test2
 
 The output of these tests should be the same as in test_1/test1.output and
 test_2/test2.output 

 To remove monitoring code (without fully rebuilding):
   make -f Makefile.Instrument uninstrument

 To clean the workspace:
   make -f Makefile.Instrument clean
   make clean
