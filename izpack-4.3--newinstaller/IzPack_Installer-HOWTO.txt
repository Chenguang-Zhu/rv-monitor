IzPack Custom Installer – How To:

-Download the IzPack source code, version 4.3.5, from github: https://github.com/izpack/izpack/tree/4.3

-Setup and build the source code in Eclipse: http://blog.samratdhillon.com/archives/426
	-Created custom panels (first 3 are adopted from the JavaMOP installer)
		PrerequisitePanel for checking Z3
		SafeTargetPanel to be able to make directories on Windows correctly
		HTMLPane to display labels
		EditedFinishPanel to warn the user about adding the directory to PATH
	-Added the new panel information to build.xml and called ant to build the custom installer code
	-Called com.izforge.izpack.compiler.Compiler with the following program arguments 
	(these are explained in detail on the given web page):
		${project_loc}/RVPredict-installer/RVPredict.xml -b ${project_loc}/RVPredict-installer 
		-o ${project_loc}/RVPredict-installer/RVPredict-install.jar -k standard
	And VM arguments:
		-DIZPACK_HOME=${project_loc}/IzPack
		
-After these steps, the installer (JAR file) is created under the directory 
	izpack-4.3--newinstaller\RVPredict-installer
All the necessary files should also be under this directory, such as the XML file (RVPredict.xml) 
to construct the installer.

-The most important file is the XML file RVPredict.xml which defines which panels are to be displayed 
when the installer is run, which sources to stay after the installation and where they should be 
located, etc.

-If you decide to change the License and Readme files, just copy the new ones and paste them in 
the above directory and build the installer again. If you prefer to change the directory structure, 
just make sure you change the corresponding paths in the XML file too.

-Currently the RV Predict libraries under sources directory are the ones that Jeff used for demo. 
I changed the scripts to handle the classpaths according to the operating system but everything else 
is the same. The installer will detect the OS and install just the related scripts. If the method to 
run the tool is changed, try to adapt it by looking at the scripts under unix folder and the demo that 
Jeff gave.

-One other crucial matter is about the eng.xml file under the same directory. After the installer is built, 
you need to open it as a JAR file and replace the eng.xml file under langpacks with this one. If you 
forget to replace it, the installer will display IzPack related information on panels and also 
the Prerequisite Panel will not have a title and the company logo as it is a custom panel and its 
title information should be added explicitly to the language pack file which is only eng.xml in this case.
